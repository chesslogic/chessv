These pieces are designed by Fergus Duniho for use with Zillions of
Games and Chess diagrams. You may use them noncommercially so long as
credit Fergus Duniho with the artwork and use them to represent the
Chess pieces they're intended to represent. The pieces are abstract
and minimalist in design, each conveying a sense for how the piece
moves. Many also convey a sense of what the piece normally looks like
in Chess. Of course, this is more so for standard Chess pieces than
for others.
