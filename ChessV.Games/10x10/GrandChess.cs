	//    This class implements Chritian Freeling's Grand Chess, which 
	//    has the two missing compounds from Chess (similar to Capablanca 
	//    Chess) but on a 10x10 board.  The game is notable for the pawn 
	//    promotion rule (optional promotion at the 8th and 9th rank, 
	//    mandatory at the 10th, but promotion only to a captured piece 
	//    with which it is replaced,) and the lack of castling (argued 
	//    unnecessary because the rooks are already connected.)
