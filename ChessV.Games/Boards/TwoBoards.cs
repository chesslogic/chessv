	//    This class derives from the Board class and implements two  
	//    side-by-side boards of the given size for games such as Alice 
	//    Chess.  The constructor is passed the number of ranks and files 
	//    of one board and the files are doubled for the second board. 
	//    The two boards aren't "connected" - the direction movement 
	//    matricies don't allow movement from one board to another.  Any 
	//    movement between boards is handled by the Game (for example, 
	//    by adding the AliceRule.)

			//	matricies will be initialized correctly for the first board 
			//	and not reach the second.  We'll copy them to the second 
			//	board later.  We do tell it the total number of squares though
