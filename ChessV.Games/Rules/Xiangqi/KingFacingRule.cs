	//                        KingFacingRule
	//
	//    This rule makes it illegal for the two kings to face each other 
	//    on an open rank, file, or diagonal unless a piece is between 
	//    them.  This is used in both Xiangqi and Eurasian Chess.
	//
	//    NOTE: In Eurasian Chess it is not possible for the kings to 
	//    be on the same rank since the Kings cannot cross the river, 
	//    and in Xiangqi the kings can't be on the same diagonal either.
	//    We include this anyway for purposes of making the rule more 
	//    generic and reusable.
