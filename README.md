ChessV is a free, open-source universal chess program with a graphical user interface, sophisticated AI engine, and other features of traditional Chess programs. As a "universal" chess program, it not only plays orthodox Chess, it is also capable of playing games reasonbly similar to Chess. It currently plays over 100 different chess variants, and can be programmed to play additional variants.

Features
 - Plays over 100 different Chess variants, including some that are quite exotic.
 - Has a fully-featured graphical user interface, but the engine can also be used separately under another GUI (such as WinBoard) and other compliant engines can be used with ChessV's GUI.
 - Has a scripting language to allow configuration of new variants. It supports combining existing pieces and rules, and even defining new pieces, but creation of new rules is not supported.
 - Plays with a fairly high level of skill. The engine can also be configured to weaken its skill level.
 - ChessV is a .NET application so it can be run under Linux or MacOS using Mono.
